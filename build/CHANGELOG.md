## [2.3.0] - 2024-08-16

### Added
- add **Sidebar On Pages**:The page sidebar allows you to inject a sidebar into the web pages you are browsing without opening the browser sidebar to manage tabs. This is a very useful feature for users with smaller screen resolutions who find the browser sidebar too wide and unadjustable. However, due to some restrictions, the page sidebar only offers very limited functionality. When this feature is enabled, you can use the mouse to hover over the edge of the window to bring out the sidebar.

- remove **Float ball**
